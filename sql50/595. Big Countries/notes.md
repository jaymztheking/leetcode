# Things I used

- pandas loc function
- very basic SQL

# Thoughts on my solution

Only thoughts here are that using loc i think is a more elegant solution than pulling a pandas series, then turning it back into a frame with to_frame.  Granted this was the first problem that required multiple columns to be returned.
