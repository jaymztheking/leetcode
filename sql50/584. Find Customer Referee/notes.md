# Things I used

- pandas to_frame
- very basic SQL, with OR this time
- pandas isnull function

# Thoughts on my solution

Still quite easy, although a slight wrinkle added in the predicates requiring an "or" rather than an "and".  This is a nod to the sometimes counterintuitive concept in SQL filtering where "and" usually means less rows and "or" means more rows.  The schema generation code was a lot better this time.
